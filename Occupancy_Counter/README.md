# Occupancy Counter

This project is my submission for [Team SHUNYA](https://teamshunya.com/) 's recruitment assignment.

### Problem Statement:

The goal of this project is to accurately detect the occupancy of a room. By knowing whether a room is occupied or not, we can implement smart automation solutions to optimize electricity usage and enhance overall energy efficiency. Additionally, this information can be utilized to trigger other intelligent automation systems, improving convenience and operational efficiency.
