# Discord Chat Bot - Peter Griffin (Family Guy)

## Overview

**Dialogue Dataset :** https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gokulrajkmv/family-guy-dialog/data

 **Model :** Dialo GPT - 345M

A chatbot model should give quick responses and should be easy to load. This model is chosen majorly because of lower size (compared to other small LLMs OLMO - 1B, LLAMA 3B etc)

*"DialoGPT is a SOTA large-scale pretrained dialogue response generation model for multiturn conversations"(... huggingface).*

*The base model was finetuned using the dialogues from the dataset.*
